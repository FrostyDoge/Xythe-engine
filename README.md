# About
Xythe engine is… basically Psych engine with extra steps but maybe overhauled in another engine (maybe 3D :3) in the near future. (who knows :3c)
Xythe engine aims to fix what Psych engine 1.0+ should have. Namely WINNING ICONS because I'm sick to death of finding no fnf engines using it. V-Slice uses winning icons! Right now we're in very early development so uh… Have fun!
# Credits
I did 0.0.1 myself, using OS Engine as a reference to add winning icons. FrostyDoge did the rest of the programming.
Pysch engine is made by ShadowMario, Friday Night Funkin' was made by Funkin' team.
OS Engine is made by Notweuz.
Uhm…
Idk what else to write
